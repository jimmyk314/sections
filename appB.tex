Flow Sensor Data Acquisition Source Code

\begin{flushleft}
 What follows is the source code used to build the flow sensor data acquisition front panel. This code is to be run in a Visual Basic Compiler, specifically VB 5.0 or 6.0 using a Win98 operating system. This code requires that RSTimer be installed in the Visual Basic Environment. Additionally, parallel port addresses and ports should be aligned and set in the code before use.
