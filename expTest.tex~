\subsection{Stormwater Discharge Simulations}

\subsubsection*{Aggregate Samples}
An experiment was devised to measure a thermal exchange between water and a sample of gravel. To measure the exchange in a hydro-dynamic scenario, a so-called stormwater discharge simulator was constructed to flush a body of gravel with heated water at high rates for up to 5 minutes. Temperature sensors measured water temperature and provided time-based temperature data for an analysis of the heat exchange between water and aggregate. In each group of experimental trials, a family of 9 gravel or rock samples was measured, each with a packed volume of 5.60 liters (Appendix B).

Quartzite and metasiltstone gravel samples were acquired from a local quarry that processes only construction aggregates that are mined on site. These samples include a range of sizes crushed for general construction and asphalt production. Quartzite aggregates are noted for their irregular cobble geometry and relatively high Mohs hardness of 7, which makes it especially suitable for use in non-partitioned arrangements \cite{ballast}. The other samples were acquired from a local landscaping retailer. Marble garden rocks, though comparably exotic, were selected for their especially high density and heat capacity. The brick sample was simply red, crushed construction brick that was sorted into two general sizes. Round river cobble and red colored medium siltstone were selected for shape and material variation. Finally unplated, mild steel balls (1018 non-annealed alloy) and glass marbles were also tested primarily as theoretically ideal aggregates in one or more thermal parameters.

\subsubsection*{Temperature Measurement}
In measuring temperature, HOBO sensors by Onset Solutions were launched and used for each trial, with data being collected from each sensor after every experiment. Each sensor was ultimately modified to provide a 3 second temperature responsivity \ref{App1}, as default manufacturer times are well over 5 minutes. The modification involved moving the temperature themistor to the outside of the sensor casing so that it was directly in contact with the fluid, and then re-sealing the unit.

 \label{modSens}
 \centering\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{modSensor.jpg}
 \caption{\emph{A modified HOBO sensor:} This shows a HOBO temperature sensor modified to provide better thermal responsivity.}
\end{figure}
\end{center}

In figure (\ref{modSens}) the sensor modification is visible as the protruding temperature element from the end of the sensor body. The semi-conductor that generates the signal for the sensor circuit is encased in a small, black epoxy bulb and this was filed down to further decrease the thermal responsivity with some success. The hole that was drilled in the plastic sensor case was sealed with a a hot/cold temperature cyanoacrylate cement. Before final reassembly, the sensor cavity was filled with a household expanding foam to further protect the sensor circuit from water infiltration. A typical failure mode for this modification was the sensor wires cracking and consequently causing a short circuit. 

Sensors used in all trials were first matched and calibrated by immersing them in heated fluids and selecting the sensors that only had similar readouts for responsivity and temperature. The modifications induced a greater variance on sensor accuracy, and so this process was implemented to control that. The sensor sampling rate was 1 second, and it was found that the sensors acheived about 50\% true value within that time frame under the most extreme temperature differences. Under the temperature differences found in a single trial, it was observed that such true temperature readings within a sample cycle were much closer, within a degree. 

Measurement error in all data originates with the sensors. There is a temporal error associated not only with just the thermal responsivity but additionally with the synchronization of individual sensors with respect to one another. This synchronization error was found to be up to 1 second in difference and is sourced to the software and personal computer when the sensors are launched. Top and bottom sensors were always carefully ``matched'', in that they measured temperatures very near one another with nearly the same responsivity. A true temperature is not as critical since all fundamental results were interpreted from a temperature difference.

\subsubsection*{Apparatus Construction Basics}
An apparatus \ref{discharger} was constructed to measure the ability of an aggregate sample to thermally sink a continuous flow of heated water. The apparatus consisted of a main circuit through which heated water was continuously circulated from a reservoir and afterwards discharged. The vessel that contained the aggregate sample was oriented vertically, with hot water introduced at the top of the vessel. Using HOBO sensors, flow temperature was measured before the water entered the sample vessel, and after. A flow sensor measured the flow rate shortly after the sample vessel.

\subsubsection{Apparatus Operation}
A sample or aggregate material was dumped into the vessel, which was removed from the main circuit. The sample was checked for correct packing and the vessel was installed into the main circuit to complete the assembly of the apparatus. The reservoir was filled with 40 liters of water typically heated to 45-50 $^{o}$C. 

An electric centrifigal pump was used to circulate water from the reservoir up to the top of the sample vessel. The pumping rate was adjustable with a gate valve that returned a certain fraction of the flow to the pump prime. The sample vessel was 4'' in diameter and 26.5'' in length, cut from a length of schedule 40 PVC. A drainage basket was fitted into the end to restrain the sample, yet afford minimal flow obstruction. The vessel performed as a gravitationally charged fluid coupling, through which water freely flowed through the interstitial space of the aggregate. Because gravity drives the flow, the type of aggregate not the pumping rate, was the dominant control of flow in the vessel. It should be noted that the maximum flow rate produced by the pump was accomodated by all aggregate samples. This was verified by the use of a clear overflow vent tube installed in the side of the sample vessel. If the net inflow were to exceed the effluent, the accumulation of fluid relative to the vessel height would appear in the clear vent tube, and this was never observed during a trial in which data was collected.

A second flow circuit was used to circulate water before the trial was to begin. This second circuit paralleled the primary sample circuit, except branching off just prior to the top temperature sensor and bypassing the sample vessel, returning all water to the reservoir. This circuit was used for 2-3 minutes prior to flushing the sample, and then disabled with a gate valve once the main circuit was opened. This recirculatory circuit was used to flush out cold pump prime water and to heat the circuit piping and brass pump head prior to collecting data. This warm-up helped to normalize the energy flow into the sample vessel and provided an initial thermal charge with a temperature closer to the actual reservoir temperature. The reservoir temperature dropped nominally when turning on this circuit. 


\subsubsection*{Run-Time Specifics}

When conducting a trial, the following procedure was followed to carry out a single flow experiment:

\begin{itemize}
 \item The two personal computers that manage data collection are time syncronized via a network connection. This is typically  done only once every hour. 
 \item The temperature sensors are first launched and installed in their respective positions around the circuit.
	\subitem Reservoir Sensor (Tank)
        \subitem Internal Vessel Sensor (Sample)
	\subitem Sensor above the vessel (Top)
        \subitem Sensor below the vessel (Bottom)
 \item Each sensor is configured to begin data recording at a common time to allow for easy time syncing of data. The sensors are ultimately verified that they are active before following through with the trial.
 \item The reservoir tank is filled with 40 liters of hot water at about $\sim48^{o}\,C$.
 \item The vessel is verified by touch that is has cooled if the current run trails another. No less than 10 minutes was allowed between trials. The vessel is then filled with an aggregate sample. Aggregate samples were unchanged for all trials. Only dry, room temperature aggregates were used for trials.
 \item The vessel is connected to the circuit. Precautions were taken to ensure no circuit leakage, and no trials exhibited any measurable fluid loss.
 \item The secondary circuit is opened and the pump is switched on, allowing a warming of the inflow piping. 
 \item The flow sensor is turned on and inspected for debris or obstructions. The DAQ front panel for the flow sensor is activated and records a time stamp.
 \item With respect to the DAQ time stamp, the secondary circuit is turned off after no less than 2 minutes. By design, once the secondary circuit is deactivated, water is then directed into the main sample circuit. 
 \item The flow sensor DAQ is activated once the flow sensor receives flow. The interface then begins recording flow data every second.
 \item The trial will last anywhere from 40-300 seconds, dependent on flow rate. A restrictor valve at the pump head can be manipulated to redirect a fraction of flow back into the pump prime. This was used only to achieve low, medium and high flow rate trials and was not adjusted during a data collecting trial.
 \item Once the pump prime has run dry and flow has ceased, the main circuit is closed. Flow sensor data is retrieved from the front panel and the DAQ is shut down, as prolonged use renders it unstable.
 \item The sensors are removed from the circuit and the vessel is disconnected.
 \item The sample is emptied to dry in a seive and a small fan is placed in the vessel to cool and dry it for the next trial.
 \item Data is removed from the temperature sensors and they are shut off.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Apparatus Error}
It was found that all samples were thermally exhausted within the amount of time 40 litres of water was flushed, regardless of rate, and this was the usual quantity circulated for a single trial. Background loss trials were performed demonstrating energy losses inside the vessel did not exceed the signal noise of the temperature sensors, and such this noise was not subtracted or otherwise considered in data analysis.

The flow sensor was calibrated using various known gravitationally driven flow rates. The circuit was plumbed to afford a continuous backpressure on the sensor to limit turbulent flow and air bubble contamination in the rotary vane cavity. Additionally, the effluent downspout was top vented so that the outflow would not siphon or draw additional flow through the sensor. Despite these provisions, the flow sensor was observed to ingest significant air and endure periodic turbulent flow, based on the driving flow rate. Further more, the rotary vane has a manufacturer tolerance of $\pm$10\%. While some of the turbulence and flow error has been absorbed into the interface calibration, the meter still demonstrated some error as a function of flow rate. For each trial, the reservoir was carfully filled to 40 litres (unless otherwise specified) and flow losses were neglected. A linear flow correction ratio was then computed for each data set.

\[flow\:correction\:ratio\;=\frac{measured\;cumulative\;flow}{measured\;reservoir\;volume}\]

In normalizing temperature differences and in an attempt to generate ideal data sets, the alternate warming circuit was used to achieve nominal differences between the top and reservoir temperatures at run time. Temperature differences between the top and reservoir sensors was never exactly zero and varied exponentially as a function of time during the actual trial. This difference will partially be absorbed in the data analysis by only considering temperature differences across the vessel, but it will remain a known source of noise and curve distortion. 

The HOBO sensors were always calibrated and paired for use across the the vessel. However, no two sensors were measured to be exact, especially with respect to responsivity and accuracy. The sensors were not manufactured for fast responsivity and the aforementioned modifications increased the variability of each sensor, in exchange for dramatically faster responsivity. Variations in sensor readings were most notably manifested in offset equilibria, or a failure for the vessel temperature difference to reach zero, even when the aggregate was clearly thermally saturated. 

Because the temperature sensors were recording temperature continuously and were not triggered, the temperature data that was recorded across the sample vessel was unsynchronized with respect to the flow. The bottom temperature sensor was effectively reading the water temperature up to 6 seconds after the top sensor due to the vessel residency time of the flow. 

\[Vessel\:Residency\:Time\;=\;\frac{Vessel\:Length}{Flow\:Velocity}\]

\noindent Where the flow velocity is actually an involved empirical function of gravity, aggregate fineness, pump flow rate and aggregate packing ratio. This is discussed in the theory section. 

Sample, top and bottom temperature derivatives were plotted and time shifted figure (\ref{timeSync}) such that the rise in temperature due to flow for each sensor was aligned in the time domain. The time shift also offers an approximate determination for vessel residency time and vessel flow velocity. There is significant error in this detmination since both sensors cumulatively can produce an error of $\pm2\;seconds$ due to sampling syncopation and instrument timing variations. However, it does provide a useful baseline to compare flow differences between aggregates. 

Inflow was observed to be sufficiently turbulent such that there was no preferential flow into or about the sample. Additionally, all cobbles were noted to be equally well heated by touch upon emptying the vessel with no dry or cold ``spots''. Trials were run exclusively in ambient temperatures of $19-22^{o}\;C$. It has been hypothesized with some supporting data that the largest sources of error in the measurement of temperature was the sensors themselves and the variant reservoir temperatures.
