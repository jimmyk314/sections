C. James Kelly was born in State College, PA to James P. and Mary Ellen Kelly. James has one sister, Megan who resides in State College, PA with her husband Ron and her new son, Ronald Patrick. James graduated from State College Area High School in June 1993 with a trade diploma in technical illustration and went on to work for the Office of Telecommunications at The Pennsylvania State University as an engineering assistant and draftsman. 

He graduated from Mansfield University of Pennsylvania with a BSE degree in Mathematics, while also fulfilling the requirements for the BSE degree in Physics. He completed two student teaching assignments, one at Southside High School in Elmira, New York under Mr. Charlie Wilson teaching Regents Physics, and one at Northern Tioga High School in Lawrenceville, Pennsylvania under Mrs. Cheryl Matteson teaching high school geometry. 

He then accepted a job teaching high school Math and Physics at Rockbridge High School in Lexington, Virginia. James successfully doubled the number of students enrolled in physics by his third year  and expanded a section of the school's precalculus course to be taught simultaneously with a section of introductory physics.

James accepted a position at Virginia State Polytechnic Institution and State University (Virginia Tech) in August 2005 as an instructor at the nationally recognized Math Emporium. 

James was married to Mary Dean Coleman in August of 2006, a PhD graduate of Virginia Tech, and the two then relocated to Boone, NC where Mary Dean accepted a faculty position. James was simultaneously accepted into the Engineering Physics graduate program in the department of Physics and Astronomy.

James is now relocating back to his hometown, where Mary Dean has accepted a professorship at The Pennsylvania State University. James hopes to pursue a technologically intensive research job.
